4. [TypeError](#typeerror)
5. [IndexError](#indexerror)
6. [KeyError](#keyerror)
7. [ValueError](#valueerror)
8. [AttributeError](#attributeerror)

## Keyboard Shortcuts Covered

### Python Commands

- **Get quotations around text**: Highlighting and press ‘ or “
- **Get parentheses around text**: Highlight and press (
- **Get brackets around text**: Highlight and press [
- **Comment out**: `cmd /`
- **Indent multiple lines at once**: `cmd ]` for left `cmd [` for right
- **Highlight the same text multiple times**: Highlight and `cmd d` the amount of times you want to highlight
- **Google doc commands** (`cmd v`, `cmd c`, `cmd x`, `cmd a`, shift-click)
- Not a shortcut, but **find and replace in Jupyter** is helpful
- **Copy line**: `cmd c`

### Jupyter Commands

**Command Mode**

- **Go to edit a cell**: Enter
- **Run current cell**: `shift enter`

- **Create cell above**: `b`
- **Delete cell**: `dd`
- **Cut Current cell**: `x`
- **Copy current cell**: `c`
- **Paste cell below**: `v`
- **Paste cell above**: `V`
- `?` after a function such as numpy or pandas to see what the function does or how to use it (like documentation)

**Edit Mode**

- **Go to command mode**: Escape
